### Why did I make this?: 
* This was an assignment for UCSD's Full Stack Bootcamp. Building this application allowed me to practice creating, reading, and updating updating data to a mySQL database. 


### How to use this application:
* To interact with this application, clone the repo to your computer. In your terminal, navigate to the project folder. To use the customer view, type "node bamazon_customer.js" into the command line. For manager view, navigate to the bamazon_manager folder, and then type "node bamazon_manager.js". 
* The terminal will then show you a list of items available for purchase. Use the arrow keys to select an item to purchase.
